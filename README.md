# Laser Lander: A Lunar Lander Clone Without Control of the Lander

Instead of directly controlling the lunar lander, you use a laser to 'shoot' the lander, which propels it upwards (or the direction it's facing). You hit the lander edge on to turn it.

Ideas for Future Improvement

- Reflecting lasers off mirrors
- Multiple landers at once
- Multiple lasers
- Destructible landing pad/base
- Enemies! UFOs? Maybe fake landers that explode your stuff
